    Selecting the focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design questions.
</h1>
<h2>
    It always costs us time and efforts to create a prototype, no matter how simple that is. So, being able to do so effectively becomes very important. Choosing the right focus can lead us as a designer to a further step of our product development by receiving the feedback from users.
</h2>
<h1>
    Finally, prototypes are not self explanatory: looks can be deceiving.
</h1>
<h2>
    It happens a lot that an interviewee gets the wrong idea of what the prototype is about by just looking at it. So the designer will need to explain the content of the prototype, but also be sure not to give inductive guidances so that the feedback can be relatively subjective.
</h2>
<h1>
    An interesting side-effect of this prototype was that its directness made it a powerful prop for promoting the project within the organization.

    Humans are highly visual creatures, we are attracted to beautiful things involuntarily. People usually lay more eyes on a beautiful designed product even before they understand what it is.
